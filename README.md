# Instruction-Tuned Healthcare Chatbot with RAG Architecture

## Motivation

Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in conversational agents. [cite: 1] However, their general pretraining often leads to inaccuracies, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare. [cite: 2] This project addresses this by combining instruction tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure chatbot responses are grounded in reliable, external medical knowledge. [cite: 3]

## Approach

* **Instruction Tuning:** We use a supervised fine-tuning objective:

    $\mathcal{L}_{instr}=-\sum_{i=1}^{N}log~P(y_{i}|x_{i};\theta)$

    where $x_{i}$ is the instruction prompt, $y_{i}$ is the expected output, and $\theta$ represents the model parameters. [cite: 4]

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** RAG integrates dense retrieval with generative modeling:

    $P(y|q)=\sum_{d\in\mathcal{D}}P(y|q,d)\cdot P(d|q)$

    where q is the query, D is the document set, and $P(d|q)$ is calculated using vector similarity. [cite: 5]

## Architecture

* **Model:** Transformer-based LLAMA 2-7B [cite: 6]
* **Retriever:** FAISS with dense vectors from Sentence Transformers [cite: 6]
* **Corpus:** Curated medical documents from trusted clinical literature [cite: 6]
* **Pipeline Steps:**

    1.  Embed query q and calculate similarity scores:

        $score(q,d_{i})=cos(\phi(q),\phi(d_{i}))$ [cite: 6]

    2.  Retrieve the top-k documents based on similarity. [cite: 6]
    3.  Concatenate query and context:

        $x=concat(q,d_{1},...,d_{k})$ [cite: 7]
    4.  Generate response $y\sim P(y|x;\theta)$ [cite: 8]

## Results

* 25% increase in factual consistency compared to the baseline LLAMA, measured using ROUGE-L and BERTScore
* Achieved sub-second average inference time using optimized batch inference
* Significantly reduced hallucination rate in clinical QA tasks

## Future Work

* Integrate Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for continuous improvement
* Incorporate multilingual support with cross-lingual retrieval embeddings
* Utilize structured ontologies like SNOMED and UMLS for symbolic augmentation
* Experiment with hybrid sparse-dense retrieval to improve document recall
